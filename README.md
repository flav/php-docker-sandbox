WIP; Need to do a lot more stuff, but this is as far as I got with the time I hadâ€¦

Trying to get a decent `docker` setup for some php dev.

# Quick start:

_once docker is installed_

create a `.env` file using `dot.env` as a template

  - `script/start`
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    *note: takes a few for the mysql container to startup - may see PDO error
  - `script/stop` when done
  - `script/docker-clean` to reset (e.g. if you make a change to a Dockerfile)


## Handy commands

- `script/php-shell` root bash shell in php container
- `script/mysql` mysql command as root in mysql container
- `script/mysqldump` will dump mysql db (for updating `docker/mysql/default_schema.sql`)


# PHP

To install a composer dependency:

`script/composer require google/apiclient`


# TODO

- TODO: better readme
- TODO: bootstrap script to check dependencies
- TODO: self signed ssl cert for nginx
- TODO: informational output after `script/start` is run (e.g. echo link+port)
- TODO: better base php image with more common/useful extensions (+memcache container?)
